# Cursor-Module
# Multiplayer Cursor Integration

A version of this module is currently in use in [The Cooper Union](https://cooper.edu)'s [End of Year Show 2021.](https://endofyearshow2021.cooper.edu) Originally intended to provide a sense of interactivity and collaboration to the show, [Erin Sparling](https://erinsparling.glitch.me) made [me, Ricky Yurewitch](https://ricc.glitch.me) aware that we could extend the functionality of this project so that it could be added as a standalone cursor implimentation for anyone's use. This is the realization of that fantasy.
